/* Convert YUV to RGB.
 * Input frame can be any 4:4:4 or 4:2:2 sampled YUVlib format.
 * The output frame is assumed to comprise three BYTE arrays, but these
 * will typically be interleaved. The RGBpixelStride value is the address
 * increment used to get from one R, G or B value to the next R, G or B
 * value. This is most likely to be 3, but may sometimes be 4.
 * The RGBlineStride value is the address increment to get from one R, G
 * or B value to the R, G or B value immediately below. It is probably the
 * image width multiplied by RGBpixelStride, but might be rounded up to get
 * a particular alignment in some systems.
 * The minimum size of workSpace is in_frame->Y.w * 2.
