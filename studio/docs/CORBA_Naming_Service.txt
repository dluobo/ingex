How to install a CORBA Naming Service
=====================================

Recorders advertise themselves in the naming service and controllers
(or RecorderClient) use it to find the recorders.

With RPM-installed ACE/TAO
--------------------------

Edit the file
  /etc/tao/tao-cosnaming

(formerly /etc/sysconfig/TAO-cosnaming)

and change the TAO_COSNAMING_ENDPOINT line to something like:

  TAO_COSNAMING_ENDPOINT="-ORBEndPoint iiop://192.168.1.100:8888 -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1"

The IP address should be one of the addresses of the machine.  You can omit
the address (e.g. iiop://:8888) to get the default address of the machine
but this may result in the naming service using an endpoint of localhost,
which won't be accessible from other machines.

You can use a hostname instead of IP address if you're using DNS.
In that case, don't put -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1

NB. In older versions of the RPM, the config is in
  /etc/sysconfig/TAO-cosnaming

You need to create that file and make an entry for TAO_COSNAMING_ENDPOINT as
above.


Then in YaST, System, System Services (runlevel):

Enable the service "tao-cosnaming"


With manually-installed ACE/TAO
-------------------------------

root> cd ...ingex/studio/scripts
root> cp Naming_Service /etc/init.d

Now edit /etc/init.d/Naming_Service

Change the ACE_ROOT= line to reflect your ACE_ROOT
In the NAMING_OPTIONS= line, put the IP address of your machine

root> chkconfig -a Naming_Service
root> /etc/init.d/Naming_Service start
