How to install a CORBA Naming Service
=====================================

Recorders advertise themselves in the naming service and controllers
(or RecorderClient) use it to find the recorders.

With RPM-installed ACE/TAO
--------------------------

Create the file
  /etc/sysconfig/TAO-cosnaming

containing:

  TAO_COSNAMING_ENDPOINT="-ORBEndPoint iiop://:8888 -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1"

You may want to put an explicit IP address or hostname in that line.
(Don't put -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1 if you want to use hostname rather then IP address.)


Then in YaST, System, System Services (runlevel):

Enable the service "tao-cosnaming"


With manually-installed ACE/TAO
-------------------------------

root> cd ...ingex/studio/scripts
root> cp Naming_Service /etc/init.d

Now edit /etc/init.d/Naming_Service

Change the ACE_ROOT= line to reflect your ACE_ROOT
In the NAMING_OPTIONS= line, put the IP address of your machine

root> chkconfig -a Naming_Service
root> /etc/init.d/Naming_Service start
