Installation of ACE/TAO/MPC using YaST
======================================


Setup access to online repository
---------------------------------

In YaST, Software, Software Management

Add a repository:

protocol             http
server name          download.opensuse.org
port                 80
directory on server  /repositories/devel:/libraries:/ACE/openSUSE_10.3

Complete URL is:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/libraries:/ACE/openSUSE_10.3/ 

Install packages
----------------

Then in YaST, Software, Software Management

Install these packages:

ace
ace-devel
ace-gperf
mpc
tao
tao-devel
tao-cosnaming

The following dependencies should also be installed if YaST requests
them, although they are not really needed:

ace-xml
ace-kokyu

Configure the CORBA naming service
----------------------------------

Create the file
  /etc/sysconfig/TAO-cosnaming

containing:

TAO_COSNAMING_ENDPOINT="-ORBEndPoint iiop://:8888 -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1"

You may want to put an explicit IP address or hostname in that line.
(Don't put -ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1 if you want to use hostname rather then IP address.)


Then in YaST, System, System Services (runlevel):

Enable the service "tao-cosnaming"


Check environment
-----------------

Log out, log back in and check you have environment variable ACE_ROOT
Do not set ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT or LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your .bashrc
