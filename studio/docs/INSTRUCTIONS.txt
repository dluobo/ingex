General
-------

Install SUSE 10.3 64-bit version with default user "ingex"


Structure
---------

The various components of "Ingex Studio" can be split across
different machines or all run on the same machine.

Separate instructions are provided for the components in the
following files:

  RECORDER.txt
  DATABASE.txt
  CONTROLLER.txt
  WEBSERVER.txt
  CORBA_Naming_Service.txt


NVIDIA graphics card driver
---------------------------

See instructions at http://en.opensuse.org/NVIDIA

To add the repository use:
  root# zypper ar http://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/11.1/ NVIDIA

(If you try to add the repository in the normal way with YaST, it
doesn't work.)

Then in YaST, software management, install:
  x11-video-nvidiaG02, nvidia-gfxG02-kmp-default

Note that for 10.3 the G01 driver works better.

If the install process updates the kernel (e.g. if you use 1-click-install),
you should update kernel sources (in yast) and do the make oldconfig,
make scripts/mod/ and driver_create stuff to rebuild the DVS card driver.

You can check that graphics card driver is working correctly by doing:

> player --balls 8

while running top.  You shouldn't see significant CPU usage by Xorg or X.


Old instructions which should now be found elsewhere
----------------------------------------------------

Install from YAST:
  kernel sources
  unixODBC
  unixODBC-devel
  psqlODBC
  libuuid1
  libuuid-devel
  libjpeg-devel
  fontconfig-devel
  ncurses-devel
  xorg-x11-devel
  perl-DBI
  perl-DBD-Pg
  apache2
  postgresql-server
  (gkrellm)
  (wireshark)

Install from RPM
  codecs-for-ffmpeg-671-1.i586.rpm
  ffmpeg-DNxHD-h264-aac-11056-1.i586.rpm
  libodbc++-0.2.4pre3-1.i586.rpm

These can be found here:
  http://ingex.sourceforge.net/studio/rpms/


DVS
---

First need to configure kernel:

root> cd /usr/src/linux
root> make oldconfig
root> make scripts/mod/  (trailing slash important)

DVS SDKs are available to registered users here:
  http://www.dvs.de/products/video-boards/centaurus-ii/login-area/video-boards/sdk.html

get SDK e.g. sdk3.2.1.0.tar.gz and untar

ingex> cd linux-x86/driver
ingex> ./driver_create
ingex> sudo ./driver_load


ACE/TAO
-------

Build according to instructions in separate document


Database access
---------------

(see database/install/INSTALL.txt)

Create and edit:
  /etc/unixODBC/odbcinst.ini
  /etc/unixODBC/odbc.ini


Database on machine and web config
----------------------------------

(see database/install/INSTALL.txt)

Install from YAST:
  postgresql
  postgresql-contrib
  postgresql-devel
  postgresql-libs
  postgresql-server
  apache2
  perl-DBI
  perl-DBD-Pg

Install from CPAN
  CGI
  Text::Template

For web server see web/manage/README.txt


AAF creation (via web server)
-----------------------------

Get AAFSDK e.g.

  cd <dir>
  wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/aaf/AAF-src-1.1.2.tar.gz
  tar xf AAF-src-1.1.2.tar.gz
  cd AAF-src-1.1.2
  make install

Set AAFSDKINSTALL environment variable

  export AAFSDKINSTALL=<dir>/AAF-src-1.1.2/AAFi686LinuxSDK/g++

Now make create_aaf and install

  cd <...>/ingex/studio/processing/createaaf
  make
  cp create_aaf /srv/ingex/createaaf/

  cd $AAFSDKINSTALL/bin/debug
  cp libcom-api.so /srv/ingex/createaaf/

Make sure that the destination directory for AAF files is
writeable by user www-run


FFMPEG
------
Install RPMs:
  codecs-for-ffmpeg-671-1.i586.rpm
  ffmpeg-DNxHD-h264-aac-11056-1.i586.rpm


Player
------

You need the following external libraries:
* ffmpeg (part of the ingex rpms)
* portaudio (YaST)
* (optional) DVS (part of ingex rpms)

You need to build and install (make; sudo make install, which installs the 
libraries in /usr/local/lib) the following Ingex libraries:
* MXF - in ingex/libMXF/lib
* MXFReader - in ingex/libMXF/examples/reader
* d3mxfinfo - in ingex/libMXF/examples/archive/info

cd ingex/player/ingex_player
make
sudo make install


Samba shares
------------

1. Create a structure such as /video/exports/avid_online/Avid Mediafiles/MXF
   In the MXF directory, make a suitable symbolic link such as HOST.1 -> /video/mxf_online
   where HOST is the host (Avid client) you want to index the files.

2. Install samba and samba-client using Yast (it also installed another two packages as dependencies).

3. In Yast, Network Services-> Samba Server
a) enable at boot up
d) Add /video/exports/avid_online as an exported filesystem, with name avid_online
e) Do something similar for avid_offline and avid_aaf
f) Export /video as readonly - this is needed by controller for replay

4. Add samba user ingex:
   root> smbpasswd -a ingex

5. Check samba export is working: in a shell, type smbstatus

Multicast
---------

Yast->Network Services->Routing->Expert Configuration [x]->Add
    dest=224.0.0.0 gw=0.0.0.0 netmask=240.0.0.0
    (select correct network adaptor (e.g. eth0 - check mac address with ifconfig))

Once the Yast steps are run you can check the route is in place by
running "/sbin/route -n" and looking for the 224.0.0.0 route.


ffmpeg and lame manual installation
