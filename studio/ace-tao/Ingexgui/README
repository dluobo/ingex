HOW TO BUILD INGEXGUI

1) Build the C++ version of the player in ingex/player/IngexPlayer/ - see separate instructions.  If the player is built with DVS card support, ingexgui will be similarly built (and will be able to play back through a DVS card).

2) Build ACE/TAO if you haven't already built another CORBA application such as the recorder - see separate instructions

3) Build libidl if you haven't already built another CORBA application such as the recorder:

> cd .../ingex/studio/ace-tao/IDL
> $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace
> make

(Don't worry about the CIAO_ROOT and DDS_ROOT warnings.)

4) Install wxGTK:

Using YaST, make sure gtk2-devel package is installed.

Either:
Use YaST to install wxGTK-devel

Or:
Download latest wxGTK from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
Untar/configure/make/install.
# ldconfig

5) Build ingexgui:

Install autoconf, automake and libtool packages if you don't have them.
Make sure $ACE_ROOT, $TAO_ROOT and $DVS_SDK (if player has DVS card support) are defined.
In this directory:

> autoreconf
> ./configure
> make

The executable is created in ./src/
