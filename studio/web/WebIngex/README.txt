Installation
------------

Requirements:
* Apache2 web server, with static html documents in /srv/www/htdocs and cgi in /srv/www/cgi-bin
* Perl CGI, CGI::Pretty, DBI, PostgreSQL DBD modules
* Ext API

CGI and CGI::Pretty should already be present as part of perl. perl-DBI and perl-DBD-Pg can be installed using YaST.

1) edit the configuration file "ingex-config/WebIngex.conf" to match your system setup, including the IP address of your database server.
2) run "sudo ./install.sh" to install the files.
3) download and install the Ext API:
	mkdir /tmp/extinstall
	cd /tmp/extinstall
	wget http://www.extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.1.0.zip
	sudo unzip ext-3.1.0.zip 
	sudo mkdir /srv/www/htdocs/ingex/ext
	sudo mv ext-3.1.0/* /srv/www/htdocs/ingex/ext

Updating
--------

An extra script is provided to update to the latest copy from CVS without overwriting your custom config files. Instead of running install.sh, use update.sh. This will overwrite all files in your installation except those with a .conf extension. 

Usage
-----

Open your web browser to the page http://<host name>/ingex/

To view a single module, without monitoring or access to other modules, simply head to http://<host name>/ingex/#_<ModuleName>
e.g. http://localhost/ingex/#_Setup

Development
-----------

An introduction to the software structure etc is provided in Develop.txt. It may be useful as an introduction if you wish to make any changes to this software.
