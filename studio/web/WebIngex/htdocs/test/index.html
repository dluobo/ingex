		<h1>Ingex Web Server Test</h1>
		<p> Welcome to the Ingex web server basic test page. There are 3 tests to perform to check if your system is correctly configured to run IngexWeb.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check the web server is running. Success! The fact that you can see this page means that the web server is serving pages correctly!</li>
			<li>Check that the web server is configured to execute Perl scripts. <a href="/cgi-bin/ingex-config/test_perl.pl">Click here</a> to load the test page. If you get a success message, you can proceed with the next tests. If you get an error message, you will need to ensure your web server is configured to run Perl, that all the files have been installed and that the file permissions are correct.</li>
			<li>Check that the database is available, configured and that the web server can connect to it. <a href="/cgi-bin/ingex-config/test_db.pl">Click here</a> to load the test page. If you receive an error, ensure that your database server is running, that the Ingex database setup scripts have been run correctly and that the database configuration is correctly entered into the config file: /srv/www/cgi-bin/ingex-config/ingex.conf</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If all the above tests have been passed, you can use <a href="/ingex">WebIngex</a>!</p>
