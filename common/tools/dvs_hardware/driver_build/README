Alterntive method of building the DVS drivers
---------------------------------------------

Instead of using the driver_create script, here is a more portable aternative.

Download the DVS SDK as normal.

> cd $(DVSSDK)/linux-x86_64/driver  [or $(DVSSDK)/linux-x86/driver for 32-bit]

Copy the accompanying Makefile to that directory.

> make
